# Project Description
This program simulates 1-dimensional collisions with adjustable parameters: Mass of each block, Initial velocity of each block, and the coefficient of friction between the blocks and the surface. The program also graphs the velocity, momentum, and kinetic energy of each block over the course of the simulation.

# Basic Function of the Program

# Buttons
  1. The start button sets all the values to default and enters you into the simulation environment. It only appears once, when you first run the code. To get back to the start button/start screen, you must close the program and restart it.

  2. The restart button sets all the values to default and re-enters you into the simulation. All previous data that has been collected is deleted. This button appears on the DATA and SIMULATOR screens.

  3. The two-way button with options elastic and inelastic allow you to toggle between the two types of collisions. By default, the inelastic collision button is selected when you press the start or restart buttons. The currently selected button is shaded in gray with white text. If you want to select an option, click the button and it will turn gray.

  4. The data button displays the DATA screen of the program. Press this button once the simulation has finished to view the graphs of the velocity, momentum, and kinetic energy of each block.

  5. The start simulation button begins the simulation and tells the blocks to begin moving.

# Sliders
  1. The friction slider adjusts the coefficient of friction (Î¼) which determines the friction force between the blocks and the table based on their masses. There is also a sand effect that will adjust in size based on the coefficient of friction.

  2. The initial velocity sliders adjust the starting velocity of each block (m/s), and therefore affects the starting kinetic energy and momentum of each block. If there is no friction, the velocity will remain the same until the collision. If there is friction, the velocity will decrease at a constant rate.

  3. The mass sliders adjust the mass of each block (kg), and therefore affects the kinetic energy and momentum of each block. Increased mass will result in more inertia, and a higher mass object will create a greater change in velocity of a lower mass object.
